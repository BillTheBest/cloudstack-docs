  <title>Console Proxy</title>
  <para>The Console Proxy is a type of System Virtual Machine that has a role in presenting a
    console view via the web UI. It connects the userâ€™s browser to the VNC port made available via
    the hypervisor for the console of the guest. Both the administrator and end user web UIs offer a
    console connection.</para>
  <para>Clicking on a console icon brings up a new window. The AJAX code downloaded into that window
    refers to the public IP address of a console proxy VM. There is exactly one public IP address
    allocated per console proxy VM. The AJAX application connects to this IP. The console proxy then
    proxies the connection to the VNC port for the requested VM on the Host hosting the guest.
    .</para>
  <note>
    <para>The hypervisors will have many ports assigned to VNC usage so that multiple VNC sessions
      can occur simultaneously.</para>
  </note>
  <para/>
  <para>The VNC traffic never goes through the guest virtual IP, and there is no need to enable VNC
    within the guest.</para>
  <para>The console proxy VM will periodically report its active session count to the Management
    Server. The default reporting interval is five seconds. This can be changed through standard
    Management Server configuration with the parameter consoleproxy.loadscan.interval.</para>
  <para>Assignment of guest VM to console proxy is determined by first determining if the guest VM
    has a previous session associated with a console proxy. If it does, the Management Server will
    assign the guest VM to the target Console Proxy VM regardless of the load on the proxy VM.
    Failing that, the first available running Console Proxy VM that has the capacity to handle new
    sessions is used.</para>
  <para>Console proxies can be restarted by administrators but this will interrupt existing console
    sessions for users.</para>
  <para>Prior to &PRODUCT; version 4.3, the console viewing functionality used a dynamic DNS service
    under the domain name realhostip.com. This domain name assists in providing SSL security to
    console sessions. A public IP address is assigned to the console proxy. To avoid browser
    warnings for mismatched SSL certificates, the URL for the new console window was set to the form
    of https://aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd.realhostip.com. Customers viewed this URL during the console session
    creation. &PRODUCT; included the realhostip.com SSL certificate in the console proxy VM. Because
    &PRODUCT; cannot know the DNS records of customers' public IPs prior to shipping the software, a
    dynamic DNS server is run that is authoritative for the realhostip.com domain. It mapped the
    aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd part of the DNS name to the IP address aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd on lookups. This allowed
    the browser to correctly connect to the console proxy's public IP, where it then expects and
    receives a SSL certificate for realhostip.com, and SSL is set up without browser
    warnings.</para>
  <para>The realhostip.com domain has now been depreciated. As an alternate, &PRODUCT; provides a
    new mechanism based on global settings to help administrators set up secure connections across
    various deployment environments. See <xref linkend="realip-changes"/> for information on setting
    up own domain, then customize the URL of your console session to reflect your own domain
    name.</para>
